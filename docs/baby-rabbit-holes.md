# Baby rabbit holes

Ordered list of "basic" skills that need to be aquired to enjoy the ride.

Go through this slowly. It is tempting to speed-read through a book, call it done, and move on to the next book. To get the most out of this, take your time understanding each section. 

For every 5 minutes you spend reading you should spend 15 minutes tinkering around with what you just read. Break things. 

The sections "Commonly used" are examples you can easily copy/past.
